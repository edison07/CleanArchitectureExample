# Clean Architecture Example 🏗️

This is a demonstration project showcasing how to implement **Clean Architecture** principles in an iOS application.  
It aims to show how to build highly **maintainable**, **testable**, and **scalable** code structures in Swift.

---

## Project Architecture 🧩

The project follows a layered design based on Clean Architecture, including:

- **Presentation Layer (UI Layer)** 🎨  
  - Contains UI components, ViewControllers, and ViewModels
  - Handles user interaction and presentation logic
  
- **Domain Layer (Business Logic Layer)** 🧠  
  - Defines core business rules and use cases
  - Contains Entities and Repository protocols
  - Completely independent of implementation details
  
- **Data Layer (Infrastructure Layer)** 📡  
  - Provides concrete implementations for data sources (API, local storage)
  - Implements the Repository interfaces defined in the Domain Layer

## Technical Highlights 🚀

- Developed using **Swift 5.0+**
- Fully adheres to **SOLID principles**
- Implements **Dependency Injection**
- Designed for easy **Unit Testing**
- **Modular architecture** for better scalability
- Applies the **Dependency Inversion Principle**

---

## Requirements ⚙️

- **Xcode 14.0+**
- **iOS 15.0+**
- **Swift 5.0+**

---

## Getting Started 🚀

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone [repository-url]
```

2. Open the project:

```bash
cd CleanArchitectureExample
open CleanArchitectureExample.xcodeproj
```

3. Build and run the project on Simulator or a real device:

```bash
⌘ + R
```

---

## Running Tests 🧪

This project includes unit tests. You can run them by:

- Pressing **⌘ + U** in Xcode to run all tests
- Or selecting the test target in the Xcode Navigator and running manually

## Future Work 🔮

- [ ] Add real-world API integration examples
- [ ] Extend sample to SwiftUI + Clean Architecture
- [ ] Provide more modular demo modules (e.g., Authentication, Profile Management)
- [ ] Integrate TCA (The Composable Architecture) demo version
